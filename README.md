# hotncold-game

HotN'Cold game, created by Rita Doumet in February 2022.

<h3>Overview</h3>
The goal of this game is to find, in each round, the "hottest" tile on the board. The temperatures of the tiles are denoted by colors:
Red is the hottest, blue the coldest, and purple is in-between.

<h3>Sections</h3>
The main menu of the game has four sections:
<ul>
  <li> Tutorial </li>
  <li> Settings: you choose the timer and theme of your game. Your settings will be saved each time you alter them, so you won't have to set them each time you re-open the game. </li>
  <li> High score: high scores of each timer, along with the dates of those high scores. </li>
  <li> Start button </li>
</ul>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
The idea behind the game is extremely simple: finding the "hottest" (reddest) tile on the board in a limited number of clicks. 
In the game, winning a round takes you directly to the next round, unless your time is over.
Bear in mind that in each round there is a certain number of clicks that you cannot exceed. 
Every time you win a round, the number of tiles on the board increases, making the hottest tile harder to find. 
You lose either by clicking on too many tiles without finding the target tile, or by time-out.

<h3>Languages used</h3>
This game was coded using JavaFX, FXML and JavaFX CSS. The entire project was built on Eclipse and SceneBuilder.
